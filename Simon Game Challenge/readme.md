This is a simple challenge game.
Press any key on keyboard to start the game.
Click on the box which is pressed in the game.
Remember the box you have clicked.
The game will then press another box.
But this time you have to first click the box you clicked before and then the new box.
This will create a pattern using both new and older clicks.

If you click a wrong box
"GAME OVER"
